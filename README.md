# Project Description: Lung Cancer Detection Using Random Forest

Cancer is a deadly disease that affects millions of people around the world. Lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, and early detection is crucial for successful treatment. In recent years, machine learning algorithms have shown great promise in assisting doctors in diagnosing cancer.

The purpose of this project is to develop a lung cancer detection system using a random forest algorithm. The project will utilize a dataset of patient information, including medical history, CT scan images, and other relevant data. The dataset will be preprocessed to ensure accuracy and eliminate any outliers or irrelevant data.

The first step in the project will be to train a random forest algorithm on the preprocessed dataset. The algorithm will be optimized using hyperparameter tuning to ensure the best possible performance. The model will be trained on a portion of the dataset and tested on the remaining portion to evaluate its accuracy.

Once the model is trained, it will be used to predict whether a patient is at risk of developing lung cancer based on their medical history and CT scan images. The system will display the results in a user-friendly interface that can be accessed by doctors or other healthcare professionals.

The lung cancer detection system will be evaluated using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results of the evaluation will be presented in a report along with suggestions for improving the system's performance.

Overall, this project aims to provide a reliable and accurate lung cancer detection system that can assist healthcare professionals in the early diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer.
